[DuckDB](https://duckdb.org/) is a popular and powerful "in-process 
[SQL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL) 
[OLAP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Online_analytical_processing) 
[database management system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database#Database_management_system)"

It provides APIs in multiple languages, including R, Python, and Julia.

The duckdb R package uses the R Database Interface 
([DBI](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/DBI/index.html)). Learn more about using
DBI [here](https://solutions.posit.co/connections/db/r-packages/dbi/).

The [duckplyr](https://duckplyr.tidyverse.org/index.html) package provides a dplyr interface to DuckDB, making it easy to use DuckDB as a backend for data manipulation with dplyr syntax.
