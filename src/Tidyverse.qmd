# Tidyverse

The [tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org/) is a collection of packages
offering an alternative to base R or data.table for data manipulation.

Tidyverse packages are under active development. The packages themselves and their functions have changed names and syntax multiple times since their introduction. Their GitHub repositories and documentation are the best sources of up-to-date information, including which packages are considered mature and stable vs. new and experimental.

This section includes only a brief look at some tidyverse functions.
