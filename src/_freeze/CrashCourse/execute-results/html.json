This is not a crash course in statistics, data science, or \nmachine learning, but an introduction to the language itself.\n<br><br>\nIf you have any questions, write them down and make sure to ask them during \neach section's Q&A.\n\n## Introduction to Programming\n\n**Everyone can code**\n<br><br>\nEveryone can learn how to program.\nWhether it takes you a minute or a longer to learn how to write the code\nneessary to perform a certain task, you *can* master it. Do not compare \nyourself to others.\n<br><br>\nAs with most things: a) motivation is key and b) you get good with practice.\n<br><br>\nYou are here because, presumably, you have important questions to answer using data.\n<br><br>\nKnowing how to code even a little can give you the power to work with your own data \nwithout depending fully on someone else. At the same time, it makes collaborating with\nother scientists, clinicians, statisticians, etc. much more effective & efficient.\n<br><br>\nYou don't learn to code by reading books or slides, you learn to code by doing.\nIdeally, work on data you are interested in, trying to answer questions you care\nabout.\n<br><br>\nLearning to code can be exciting and frustrating. It's similar to learning to\nplay an instrument - like the guitar. At first, it may seem unnatural and\nannoying, but you can get better at it rather quickly and it's very rewarding \nand satisfying.\n<br><br>\nIt is important to be able to **read** ***and*** **write** code.\n<br><br>\n**Coding requires logic & creativity**\n<br><br>\nProgramming is based on logic and learning to code helps structure your thoughts,\nyour experiments, your reasoning.\n<br><br>\nProgramming languages are human constructs. They were built to answer important needs.\nThey develop with time, as needs evolve. Many design choices are explained historically,\na few may be more arbitrary.\n<br><br>\n**Everything is a series of simple, manageable steps**\n<br><br>\nRemember this: the shortest and simplest piece of code up to the longest and most complex\nis made of a sequence of relatively simple steps.\n<br><br>\nAlways be clear about what you want to achieve first, then break it down step-by-step\nin code. Each step is relatively easy to figure out and **check** that it is working\nas desired. A common mistake is to write multiple steps in one go, and then have \na hard time figuring out where an error occurs or why.\n<br><br>\nTo get from A to B using code there are virtually always multiple different paths.\nThat can be confusing or perhaps frustrating, but it is also exciting.\nProgramming to the uninitiated may seem a a rigid exercise but it is highly creative.\nRemember that there objective and subjective differences to consider when designing\na code to take you from A to B. Suppose you have two approaches that have the same input \nand produce the same output. An objective difference would be how fast each completes the\ntask and how many lines of code or number of function calls it requires. A subjective\ndifference would be the programming style / syntax used / whether the code is \n\"elegant\" - a pretty broad topic.\n<br><br>\n**Errors happen often but they are not all the same**\n<br><br>\nErrors in code happen all the time, it is part of the process. But, not all errors\nare the same.\n<br>\nThere are errors that:\n<br><br>\n\n- **stop execution** of code and **produce an error message**. This is the best case \nscenario because it can't go unnoticed and you are forced to address them.\n- **do not stop execution** of code but **produce a warning**. These warnings are very\n often ignored. They may be serious or trivial, but must be investigated.\n- **do not stop execution** and **produce no warnings**. This is the worst kind of error\nsince it is silent. These can be common and the only way to recognize them is\nto check the output. \n<br>\n*Always read all error & warning messages.*\n<br><br>\n**Details matter (a lot)**\n<br><br>\nA lot of mistakes occur, especially in the beginning, because a variable or function name \nis misspelled.\n<br><br>\n**Always check yourself**\n<br><br>\nRemember: the most important thing is to ensure you produce correct results at \neach step. Don't place writing smart or elegant code above writing correct code. \nSpend time reviewing your code. If possible, have one or more other people review your \ncode.\n<br><br>\n**Document everything**\n<br><br>\nMake a habit from the very beginning to always use comments in your code to \nexplain what you are trying to achieve and why. You will often need to revisit \nyour code after some time has passed. Life will be very hard if it's not clear \nwhat is happening and why. \n<br><br>\nProgramming is largely a team sport. A lot of code is written collaboratively\nor is used by people other than the author. Again, comprehensive documentation \nis super important.\n<br><br>\n**Help is at your fingertips**\n<br><br>\nWhether you are just starting out or you are a seasoned programmer, you have\nmany sources of information to help you troubleshoot or learn new skills.\n<br><br>\n\n- Use the built-in documentation! Builtin help files, written by the code author,\nare almost always the best place to start. Their quality will vary, but they\nare often sufficient to learn how to use a function properly.\n- Programming is largely an online activity. All documentation and source code\n(of open source projects) is available online. Most errors or difficulties you \nencounter have been encountered many times before by others. A very large number\nof Q&A sites, blogs, forums are a web search away. Copy-pasting an error message \ninto a search engine will often result in multiple hits.\n\n## The R language\n\n- The **S** statistical programming language was developed in 1976 at Bell Labs by \nJohn Chambers and others \"to turn ideas into software, quickly and faithfully”.\n\n- **R** is an [open source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_source) implementation of \nS developed by Ross Ihaka and Robert Gentleman at the University of Auckland, New Zealand; \ninitial version released in 1995.\n\n- Supported by the \n[R Foundation for Statistical Computing](https://www.r-project.org/foundation/), \ndeveloped by the \n[R Core Team and the contributions of many others](https://www.r-project.org/contributors.html).\n\n- Official part of the [Free Software Foundation’s](https://www.fsf.org) \n[GNU project](https://www.gnu.org/) available under \n[GNU GPL v2](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/old-licenses/gpl-2.0.html).\n\n- Latest version [4.2.2 released 2022-10-31](https://cloud.r-project.org/) (as of writing)\nThe next version, 4.2.3 will be released Sunday 2023-03-05.\n\n## Free Open Source Software\n\n**[Free Open Source Software (FOSS)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_and_open-source_software)**\nis software that is \"free\" and \"open source\" - what does that really mean?\n\n**[What is Free Software?](https://www.fsf.org/about/what-is-free-software)**\n\n> \"Free software is software that gives you, the user, the freedom to share, \n>  study and modify it. We call this free software because the user is free.\"\n> \n> <footer>--- Free Software Foundation</footer>\n\n**[What is Open Source Software](https://opensource.com/resources/what-open-source)**\n\n> \"Open source software is software with source code that anyone can \n> inspect, modify, and enhance.\"\n>\n> <footer>--- opensource.com</footer>\n\n**Why is FOSS important?**\n<br><br>\nThere are many advantage to FOSS, in general. Some of those, that are highly \nrelevant in biomedical research and clinical applications include the promotion\nof **inclusion**, **transparency**, and **trustworthiness.**\n\n## RStudio Integrated Development Environment\n\n[RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/) offers a popular, feature-full [Integrated Development Environment (IDE)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_development_environment) for R.\n<br><br>\nMore advanced users can use [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) \nwith the [R Extension](https://github.com/REditorSupport/vscode-R) for a \nsimilar R IDE experience together with all the extra functionality and \nconvenience of VS Code.\n\n## The R core language & package ecosystem\n\nR boasts extensive quantitative and statistical functionality in the base \nsystem.\n\nThis functionality is extended through a vast ecosystem of external packages.\n\n- **CRAN**: The Comprehensive R Archive Network (https://cran.r-project.org/): \n[19001 packages](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/)\n- **Bioconductor**: Bioinformatics-related packages and more \n(https://www.bioconductor.org/): \n[2083+ packages](https://bioconductor.org/about/release-announcements/)\n- **GitHub**: The largest source code host (>200M repositories; https://github.com/): \nHosts most if not all of the above and a lot more. Also hosts a copy of the entire CRAN.\n\n## Reading in Data\n\nWe shall use a heart failure dataset as an example. It is freely available at \nthe UCI repository:\n\"https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/00519/heart_failure_clinical_records_dataset.csv\"\n\nYou can either download it to a local folder or read it directly from the internet.\n(If reading directly from the internet, you may get an SSL error. In that case, you\ncan either download the file using a browser and reading it from disk, or you can try \ninstalling/updating your OpenSSL library.)\n\n### CSV\n\nAssuming you have downloaded the file to your local disk under \"/Data/UCI\", you can\nread it into R using the `read.csv()` command:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ndat <- read.csv(\"/Data/UCI/heart_failure_clinical_records_dataset.csv\")\n```\n:::\n\n\nAn important optional argument of the `read.csv()` command is `na.strings`: it lets you\ndefine which string(s) should be considered as missing data. Some common strings used to \nindicated missing data are the empty string `\"\"` or `NA`.\n<br><br>\nThe above file does not contain any missing data, so the following is only an example of\nhow you would define the `na.strings` argument if you wanted to read in a file that \nincludes missing data coded either by an empty string (\"\") or `NA`:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ndat <- read.csv(\"/Data/UCI/heart_failure_clinical_records_dataset.csv\",\n                na.strings = c(\"\", \"NA\"))\n```\n:::\n\n\n`read.csv()` can also read files directly from the internet:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ndat <- read.csv(\"https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/00519/heart_failure_clinical_records_dataset.csv\")\n```\n:::\n\n\nThe `head()` function prints the first few lines of an object:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nhead(dat)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n  age anaemia creatinine_phosphokinase diabetes ejection_fraction\n1  75       0                      582        0                20\n2  55       0                     7861        0                38\n3  65       0                      146        0                20\n4  50       1                      111        0                20\n5  65       1                      160        1                20\n6  90       1                       47        0                40\n  high_blood_pressure platelets serum_creatinine serum_sodium sex smoking time\n1                   1    265000              1.9          130   1       0    4\n2                   0    263358              1.1          136   1       0    6\n3                   0    162000              1.3          129   1       1    7\n4                   0    210000              1.9          137   1       0    7\n5                   0    327000              2.7          116   0       0    8\n6                   1    204000              2.1          132   1       1    8\n  DEATH_EVENT\n1           1\n2           1\n3           1\n4           1\n5           1\n6           1\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThe `read.csv()` function read the contents of the CSV file into an R object known\nas a `data.frame`. This is essentially a table like a spreadsheet, where each row\nrepresents a case (e.g. a subject, patient, etc.) and each column represents a\nvariable (e.g. Patient ID, Age, Sex, Dx, etc.)\n\n### XLSX\n\nTo read in XLSX files, you need to install an external package. Multiple packages can\nread such files, one of them is \n[`openxlsx`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/openxlsx/).\n\nTo install it, use the `install.packages()` command:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ninstall.packages('openxlsx')\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ndat <- openxlsx::read.xlsx(\"~/icloud/Data/UCI/heart_failure_clinical_records_dataset.xlsx\")\n```\n:::\n\n\nNote: if you want to try the above command, open the CSV file using Excel and save it as\nan XLSX file first.\n\nRead more about reading in data in @sec-dataio.\n\n## Inspect & summarize data\n\nGet data dimensions:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ndim(dat)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] 299  13\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\nLook at the data structure, including data types:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nstr(dat)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n'data.frame':\t299 obs. of  13 variables:\n $ age                     : num  75 55 65 50 65 90 75 60 65 80 ...\n $ anaemia                 : int  0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 0 1 ...\n $ creatinine_phosphokinase: int  582 7861 146 111 160 47 246 315 157 123 ...\n $ diabetes                : int  0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 ...\n $ ejection_fraction       : int  20 38 20 20 20 40 15 60 65 35 ...\n $ high_blood_pressure     : int  1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 ...\n $ platelets               : num  265000 263358 162000 210000 327000 ...\n $ serum_creatinine        : num  1.9 1.1 1.3 1.9 2.7 2.1 1.2 1.1 1.5 9.4 ...\n $ serum_sodium            : int  130 136 129 137 116 132 137 131 138 133 ...\n $ sex                     : int  1 1 1 1 0 1 1 1 0 1 ...\n $ smoking                 : int  0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 ...\n $ time                    : int  4 6 7 7 8 8 10 10 10 10 ...\n $ DEATH_EVENT             : int  1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 ...\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\nGet summary of dataset:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nsummary(dat)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n      age           anaemia       creatinine_phosphokinase    diabetes     \n Min.   :40.00   Min.   :0.0000   Min.   :  23.0           Min.   :0.0000  \n 1st Qu.:51.00   1st Qu.:0.0000   1st Qu.: 116.5           1st Qu.:0.0000  \n Median :60.00   Median :0.0000   Median : 250.0           Median :0.0000  \n Mean   :60.83   Mean   :0.4314   Mean   : 581.8           Mean   :0.4181  \n 3rd Qu.:70.00   3rd Qu.:1.0000   3rd Qu.: 582.0           3rd Qu.:1.0000  \n Max.   :95.00   Max.   :1.0000   Max.   :7861.0           Max.   :1.0000  \n ejection_fraction high_blood_pressure   platelets      serum_creatinine\n Min.   :14.00     Min.   :0.0000      Min.   : 25100   Min.   :0.500   \n 1st Qu.:30.00     1st Qu.:0.0000      1st Qu.:212500   1st Qu.:0.900   \n Median :38.00     Median :0.0000      Median :262000   Median :1.100   \n Mean   :38.08     Mean   :0.3512      Mean   :263358   Mean   :1.394   \n 3rd Qu.:45.00     3rd Qu.:1.0000      3rd Qu.:303500   3rd Qu.:1.400   \n Max.   :80.00     Max.   :1.0000      Max.   :850000   Max.   :9.400   \n  serum_sodium        sex            smoking            time      \n Min.   :113.0   Min.   :0.0000   Min.   :0.0000   Min.   :  4.0  \n 1st Qu.:134.0   1st Qu.:0.0000   1st Qu.:0.0000   1st Qu.: 73.0  \n Median :137.0   Median :1.0000   Median :0.0000   Median :115.0  \n Mean   :136.6   Mean   :0.6488   Mean   :0.3211   Mean   :130.3  \n 3rd Qu.:140.0   3rd Qu.:1.0000   3rd Qu.:1.0000   3rd Qu.:203.0  \n Max.   :148.0   Max.   :1.0000   Max.   :1.0000   Max.   :285.0  \n  DEATH_EVENT    \n Min.   :0.0000  \n 1st Qu.:0.0000  \n Median :0.0000  \n Mean   :0.3211  \n 3rd Qu.:1.0000  \n Max.   :1.0000  \n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n## Data types\n\nA vector in R is a collection of items of the same type (e.g. numbers or characters)\nof any length, including 1 (i.e. there is no distinction between a scalar and a vector).\n\nData types in R are essentially different types of vectors.\n\nR includes a number of builtin data types.
