# Vectorized Operations {#sec-vectorization}

Many built-in R functions are vectorized and so are many functions from external 
packages as well.

::: callout-info
A vectorized function operates on all elements of an object.
:::

Vectorization is very efficient: it can save both human (your) time and machine 
time.

::: callout-tip
In many cases, applying a function on all elements simultaneously may seem like the
obvious or expected behavior, but since not all functions are vectorized, make 
sure to check the documentation (and/or test whether a function is vectorized using a 
simple example).

## Operations between vectors of equal length

Such operations are applied between corresponding elements of each vector:

```{r}
x <- 1:10
z <- 11:20
x + z
```

i.e. the above is equal to `c(x[1] + z[1], x[2] + z[2], ..., x[n] + z[n])`.

```{r}
Weight <- rnorm(20, mean = 80, sd = 1.7)
Weight
Height <- rnorm(20, mean = 1.7, sd = 0.1)
Height
BMI <- Weight/Height^2
BMI
```

## Operations between a vector and a scalar

In this cases, the scalar is repeated to match the length of the vector, 
i.e. it is ***recycled***:

```{r}
x + 10
x * 2
x / 10
x ^ 2
```

## Operations between vectors of unequal length: **value recycling**

Operations between a vector and a scalar are a special case of operations 
between vectors of unequal length. Whenever you perform an operation between 
two objects of different length, 
***the shorter object's elements are recycled***:

```{r}
x + c(2:1)
```

:::callout-caution
Operations between objects of unequal length can occur by mistake. If the 
shorter object's length is a multiple of the longer object's length, there will 
be ***no error or warning***, as above. Otherwise, 
there is a warning (which may be confusing at first) BUT 
***recycling still happens and is highly unlikely to be intentional***.
:::

```{r}
x + c(1, 3, 9)
```

## Vectorized matrix operations

Operations between matrices are similarly vectorized, i.e. performed between 
corresponding elements:

```{r}
a <- matrix(1:4, nrow = 2)
b <- matrix(11:14, nrow = 2)
a
b
a + b
a * b
a / b
```

## Vectorized functions

Some examples of common mathematical operations that are vectorized:

```{r}
log(x)
sqrt(x)
sin(x)
cos(x)
```
