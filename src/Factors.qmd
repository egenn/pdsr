# Factors {#factors}

Factors in R are used to store **categorical variables** and therefore have 
many important uses in statistics / data science / machine learning.  

For example, factors can be used to store information on sex, race, diagnosis, 
treatment group, etc.

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| out-width: 80%
#| fig-align: center
#| fig-cap: Factors in R - Best to read through this chapter first and then refer back to this figure
knitr::include_graphics("./R_factors.png")
```

If you are new to R and to factors, begin with the following introductory-level 
section.

## Factors (introductory) {#factorsintro}

```{block, type="rmdnote"}
Factors in R are a special type of vector.

- Each element can take one value from a set known as the factor's 
**levels**

- A factor's levels are stored in a particular **order**, which affects how that 
factor is treated by some functions, e.g. in hypothesis testing, model fitting,
visualization, etc.

- You can specify whether or not the order of the levels defines a quantitative 
relationship such that level1 < level2, etc., in which case the factor is known 
as **ordered**
```

You can create a factor by passing a numeric or character vector to `factor()` 
or to `as.factor()`.

The difference between the two is that `as.factor()` does not accept any 
arguments while `factor()` does.

Let's start with a character vector that includes three unique values - 
"a", "b", and "c":

```{r}
x <- c("a", "c", "b", "b", "a", "a", "b", "c")
x
```

Assume that "a", "b", and "c" define three different groups and we want to 
convert this character vector to a factor.  
`as.factor()` and `factor()` without any arguments produce the same output:

### Create a factor

```{r}
xf <- factor(x)
xf
class(xf)
xftoo <- as.factor(x)
xftoo
class(xftoo)
```

Notice how a factor is printed in the R console: 

- The elements are printed without double quotes around them, differentiating 
them from character vectors.
- The factor levels are printed below the vector values.

`table()` is a very useful function for factors - it gives the counts for each 
level:

```{r}
table(xf)
```

Let's look at a different example. We define a factor to identify cases and 
controls:

```{r}
g <- factor(c("case", "control", "control", "case", "control"))
g
```

```{block, type="rmdnote"}
By default, the levels are ordered *alphabetically*.
```

### Set the order of factor levels

You can define the order of the factor levels with the `level` argument of the 
`factor()` function.

For example, the first factor level is used as the baseline in some statistical 
operations, e.g. `glm()`, in which case the "control" level should be first.

Many plotting functions order categorical axes' labels using the level order.

```{r}
g <- factor(c("case", "control", "control", "case", "control"),
            levels = c("control", "case"))
g
```

The `levels` argument can include values not present in the input data vector. 
This may be used for example when some known categories are not present in your 
sample, but may be added in the future, or you want specifically to show they 
are absent in a table or a plot, etc.

```{r}
g <- factor(c("Type I", "Type III", "Type III", "Type I"),
            levels = c("Type I", "Type II", "Type III"))
g
```

On the other hand, if the `levels` argument is specified and does not include 
one or more of the values present in the input data vector, the corresponding 
elements become `NA`:

```{r}
g <- factor(c("case", "control", "undefined", "control", 
              "case", "control", "undefined"),
            levels = c("control", "case"))
g
```

### Define level labels

You can define level names or ***labels*** other than the values in the 
input vector using the `labels` argument:

Assume you started with the following character vector:

```{r}
x <- c("female", "female", "male", "female", "male")
```

You can attach different labels to each level rather than default to 
"female" and "male" by passing a character vector to the `labels` arguments:

```{r}
xf <- factor(x, labels = c("F", "M"))
xf
```

The order of names in the `labels` argument must match the order of levels. 
In the above example, the levels default to `c("female", "male")` because they 
are sorted alphabeticaly if not specified. Otherwise, we can specify both the 
`levels` and `labels` arguments to define both order of levels and provide 
new labels:

```{r}
xf <- factor(x, 
             levels = c("male", "female"),
             labels = c("M", "F"))
xf
```

### Change level labels of existing factor

We can change the labels of a factor object 

- using the `labels` argument of the `factor()` command in the same way we 
create a factor from a character or other vector
- using the `levels()` command

Start with a factor of two groups and change labels using the `factor()` 
command:

```{r}
xf <- factor(c("GroupA", "GroupB", "GroupB", "GroupA"))
xf
```

```{r}
xf <- factor(xf, labels = c("A", "B"))
xf
```

Start with the same factor and change labels using the `levels()` command.

This is similar to using `colnames()` on a data.frame and is much faster than 
using `factor()` as above:

```{r}
xf <- factor(c("GroupA", "GroupB", "GroupB", "GroupA"))
levels(xf) <- c("A", "B")
xf
```

```{block, type="rmdcaution"}
The `levels()` command changes the ***names*** of the levels. 
It ***cannot be used to change the order of levels***, 
which must be done using `factor()`
```

## Factors (advanced)

```{block, type="rmdnote"}
A factor is a vector
A factor contains three crucial pieces of information:

1. The underlying **integer vector**

2. The **mapping of integers to labels**

3. Whether the factor is **ordered**
```

Let's unpack these.  

Begin with a simple factor:

```{r}
x <- factor(c("female", "female", "female", "male", "male"))
x
```

Internally, the command sees there are two distinct labels, female and male, 
and defaults to assigning integer numbers alphabetically, in this case female 
has been mapped to '1' and male to '2'.

Printing a factor prints the vector of labels followed by the levels, i.e. the 
unique labels.  

### The underlying **integer vector**

Each level is assigned an integer. (Internally, this is the "data" that forms 
the elements of a factor vector). You don't see these integers unless you 
convert the factor to numeric (`as.numeric()`) or look at the (truncated) 
output of `str()`

```{r}
as.numeric(x)
```

### The **mapping of integers to labels**

This defines which integer is mapped to which label, i.e. whether 1 is mapped 
to male or female. You can store the same information regardless which one you 
choose to call 1 and 2. 

To get the mapping you can use `levels()`. It prints the labels in order:

```{r}
levels(x)
```

Again, this means that female is mapped to 1 and male is mapped to 2.

```{r}
str(x)
```

The above tells you that x is a factor,  
it has two levels labeled as "female" and "male", in that order, i.e. female is 
level 1 and male is level 2.    
The last part shows that the first five elements (in this case the whole 
vector) consists of three elements of level 1 (female) followed by 2 elements 
of level 2 (male)

#### Setting new level labels

You can use the `levels()` command with an assignment to assign new labels to a 
factor (same syntax to how you use `rownames()` or `colnames()` to assign new 
row or column names to a matrix or data frame)

```{r}
xf <- factor(sample(c("patient_status_positive", "patient_status_negative"), 10, T),
             levels = c("patient_status_positive", "patient_status_negative"))
xf
```

```{r}
levels(xf)
levels(xf) <- c("positive", "negative")
xf
```

#### Defining the mapping of labels to integers

If you want to define the mapping of labels to their integer representation 
(and not default to them sorted alphabeticaly), you use the `levels` arguments 
of the `factor()` function.  

The vector passed to the `levels` arguments must include at least all unique 
values passed to `factor()`, otherwise you will get `NA` values

Without defining `levels` they are assigned alphabeticaly:

```{r}
x <- factor(c("alpha", "alpha", "gamma", "delta", "delta"))
x
```
Define `levels`:

```{r}
x <- factor(c("alpha", "alpha", "gamma", "delta", "delta"),
            levels = c("alpha", "gamma", "delta"))
x
```

The `table` command has a number of useful applications, in it simplest form, 
it tabulates number of elements with each unique value found in a vector:

```{r}
table(x)
```

If you forget (or choose to exclude) a level, all occurences are replaced by 
`NA`:

```{r}
x <- factor(c("alpha", "alpha", "gamma", "delta", "delta"),
            levels = c("alpha", "gamma"))
x
```

If you know that more levels exist, even if no examples are present in your 
sample, you can includes these extra levels:

```{r}
x <- factor(c("alpha", "alpha", "gamma", "delta", "delta"),
            levels = c("alpha", "beta", "gamma", "delta"))
x
```

```{r}
table(x)
```

### Is the factor **ordered**

We looked at how you can define the order of levels using the `levels` argument 
in `factor()`, which affects the integer mapping to each label.

This can affect how some applications treat the different levels.

On top of the order of the mapping, you can further define if there is a 
*quantitative relationship* among levels of the form 
`level 1 < level 2 < ... < level n`. This, in turn, can affect how the factor 
is treated by some functions, like some functions that fit statistical models.

```{block, type="rmdnote"}
All factors' levels appear in some order or other.

An **ordered factor** indicates that its levels have a quantitative 
relationship of the form `level 1 < level 2 < ... < level n`.
```

First an unordered factor:

```{r}
dat <- sample(c("small", "medium", "large"), 10, TRUE)
x <- factor(dat)
x
```

To make the above into an ordered factor, we need to define the order of the 
levels with the `levels` arguments and also specify that it is ordered with the 
`ordered` argument:

```{r}
x <- factor(dat,
            levels = c("small", "medium", "large"),
            ordered = TRUE)
x
```

Note how the levels now include the `<` sign between levels to indicate the 
ordering.

### Change order of levels or labels

We've seen how to create a factor with defined order of levels and how to 
change level labels already. Because these are prone to serious accidents, 
let's look at them again, together.

**To change the order of levels** of an existing factor use `factor()`:

```{r}
x <- factor(c("target", "target", "control", "control", "control"))
x
```

Change the order so that target is first (i.e. corresponds to 1:

```{r}
x <- factor(x, levels = c("target", "control"))
x
```

**To change the labels of the levels** use `levels()`:

```{r}
x
levels(x) <- c("hit", "decoy")
x
```

```{block, type="rmdcaution"}
Changing the levels of a factor with `levels()` does not change the internal 
integer representation but changes every element's label. 
```

### Fatal error to avoid

Example scenario: You receive a dataset for classification where the outcome is 
a factor of 1s and 0s:

```{r}
outcome <- factor(c(1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0))
outcome
```
Some classification procedures expect the first level to be the 'positive' 
outcome, so you decide to reorder the levels.

You mistakenly use `levels()` instead of `factor(x, levels=c(...))` hoping to 
achieve this.  

You end up flipping all the outcome values.

```{r}
levels(outcome) <- c("1", "0")
outcome
```

All zeros became ones and ones became zeros.

Your model does the exact opposite of what you intended.

### Factor to numeric

While it often makes sense to have factors with words for labels, they can be 
any character and that includes numbers (i.e. numbers which are treated as 
labels)

```{r}
f <- factor(c(3, 7, 7, 9, 3, 3, 9))
f
```

This behaves just like any other factor with all the rules we learned above.

There is a very easy trap to fall into, if you ever decide to convert such a 
factor to numeric.

The first thing that usually comes to mind is to use `as.numeric()`.

```{r}
# !don't do this!
as.numeric(f)
```
But! We already know this will return the integer index, it will not return the 
labels as numbers.  

By understanding the internal representation of the factor, i.e. that a factor 
is an integer vector indexing a set of labels, you can convert labels to 
numeric exactly by indexing the set of labels:

```{r}
levels(f)[f]
```
The above suggests that used as an index within the brackets, `f` is coerced to 
integer, therefore to understand the above:

```{r}
levels(f)
levels(f)[as.integer(f)]
# same as
levels(f)[f]
```

A different way around this that may be less confusing is to simply convert the 
factor to character and then to numeric:

```{r}
as.numeric(as.character(f))
```

## Summary

```{block, type="rmdnote"}
- Factors in R are essentially ***integer vectors with labels***.

- A factor's internal integer values range from 1 to the number of levels, i.e. 
categories.

- Each integer corresponds to a label.

- **To set order of levels**: `factor(x, levels = levels_in_desired_order)` to 
order levels

- **To change labels**: `levels(x) <- newlabels` or 
`factor(x, labels = newlabels)`   
```

```{block, type="rmdnote"}
To avoid confusion, do not use numbers as level labels, if possible.
```
